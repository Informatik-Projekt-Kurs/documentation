# Design Principles and Standards

## Fundamental Design Principles

In developing the UI/UX for Meetmate, we follow core design principles to create a user experience that is cohesive and easy to use:

1. *Consistency*: We want that our design feels and looks the same everywhere, so users can easily navigate through different sections of Meetmate.

2. *Hierarchy*: In our designs we want Information and elements be ordered in a way that helps guiding users' attention effectively.

3. *Simplicity*: We use clean and simple designs that make it easier for users to use Meetmate.

4. *Feedback*: The designs should tell the user what to do, which makes it easier for people to use and feel confident.

## Design Standards

Our design standards encompass:

- A color scheme that matches Meetmates brand identity
- Typography guidelines that ensure that text can be read across devices
- Spacing and alignment rules for a clean, organized layout
- Standards for icons and imagery to ensure visual consistency

### Flow Diagrams

Flow diagrams help us design user journeys through the application. They help us figure out where the user experience could be improved. Let's analyze the flow chart of the user onboarding, the start of a users journeys in Meetmate.

##### 1. Client Onboarding

The client onboarding process in Meetmate is designed to be easy and safe. New users start their journey on the sign-up page, where they can choose to create an account or log in if they already have an account. Furthermore, we added an email verification step to ensure security and prevent fake accounts. This process checks the user's email and makes sure they are trustworthy. Existing users are directed to the login page, so they can quickly access their accounts. This approach ensures that new and returning users have a streamlined experience.

##### 2. Company Setup

Setting up a company profile on Meetmate is important for companies who want to use our platform. The process starts by making sure that only people who have permission can create and manage company profiles. Once users are authenticated, they are guided through a series of steps to set up their company details including entering important information like the company name, industry, and other relevant details.

#### Key Takeaways from the Flow Diagram

1. *Multiple Entry Points*: Our flow chart gives different start points for clients and companies to ensure that each user type starts their individual journey in the most relevant and efficient way. This improves the overall user experience and reduces confusion.

2. *Verification Steps*: We implemented important verification processes to keep data safe and secure. The system checks if the information given by the user meets certain requirements before proceeding.

3. *Logical Progression*: The user flow is designed to help users set up their basic credentials before they can use more complicated features like company setup or creating appointments. A progression like this helps users get used to the system gradually, which reduces cognitive load and improves overall usability.
