# Backend Deployment

## **Docker**
The backend of MeetMate uses Docker to have an easy-to-use application that works consistently regardless of the host. By containerizing the application and its dependencies, Docker ensures that MeetMate can run in any environment — whether on a local machine, in a development server, or on production — without configuration inconsistencies. Docker simplifies scalability, allowing for quick adaptation to varying workloads by spinning up additional containers as needed. With Docker, MeetMate benefits from faster setup times, reliable deployments, and the ability to maintain a consistent environment across all stages of development and deployment.

## **Docker-Compose:**
In harmony with Docker MeetMate also uses Docker-Compose to streamline the deployment process. Docker-Compose not only deploys the API but also simultaneously hosts the necessary databases and manages the development interfaces. By defining all container configurations in a single YAML file, Docker Compose makes it easier to manage the entire backend infrastructure.  This unified approach allows for seamless coordination between containers, ensuring they work flawlessly together. Additionally, having everything in one place simplifies maintenance and ensures that the development and production environments remain consistent.
