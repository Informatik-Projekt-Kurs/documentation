## Role
As the designer of this project, I was responsible for creating user interfaces, designing prototypes, and ensuring a good user experience.
This role gave me many opportunities to grow professionally through new challenges, tools, and team collaboration.

## Tools and learning journey
I started my journey with Figma, where I learned to create detailed prototypes and design layouts. While it was challenging at first, I became proficient at using the platform to turn ideas into working designs. Using component libraries like shadcn and Preline UI helped me understand the importance of consistency, accessibility, and modern design principles in web applications.

This helped me create designs that looked good and worked well for users.

Through this project, I got much better at thinking about user interface design and creating experiences that make sense for users. I learned to create and test designs quickly, getting better with each version. Working with different team members improved my collaboration skills, especially in understanding what developers need. I also became much more comfortable with the professional tools we used.
