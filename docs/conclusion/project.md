# Conclusion 

## Project Summary and Future Outlook 
Throughout the development of MeetMate, our team aimed to create more than just a functional application - we set out to simulate a professional development environment and challenge ourselves technically. This approach led us to make several key decisions that shaped both our development process and the final product. 

### Development Philosophy 
Rather than relying solely on existing solutions, we chose to develop core features from scratch. Our authentication system, for instance, was built from the ground up despite the large availability of third-party solutions. This decision, while more time-consuming, provided valuable learning experiences and gave us complete control over our security implementation. This in turn made us have to account for potential security concerns or performance issues, teaching us important lessons about security best practices and the complexities of building robust authentication systems.

### Professional Environment Simulation 
We structured our development process to mirror professional practices. This included: 

- Project tracking through Jira, allowing us to manage tasks, track progress, and maintain organized sprints 
- Documentation in Confluence to ensure knowledge sharing and maintain development standards 
- Version control via GitHub for code management and collaboration 
- Team communication through Discord, providing both text and voice channels for different aspects of development 

This infrastructure proved essential for coordinating our efforts and maintaining consistent development practices across the team. 

### Project Status 
It's important to acknowledge that MeetMate remains a work in progress. While the application provides core functionality, several essential features still need to be implemented for it to be considered complete. Features like password reset, email notifications for appointments, and a more comprehensive user profile system are standard in modern applications but haven't been implemented yet. Like any software project, there may be undiscovered bugs or edge cases that need addressing.
<br><br>
Our decision to build core features from scratch, while valuable for learning, significantly impacted our development timeline. Several planned features had to be delayed as implementing basic functionality took longer than it would have with pre-built solutions.
<br><br>
Similarly, quality-of-life features such as a more sophisticated search system, advanced filtering options, and detailed analytics dashboards remain on our roadmap. While these features would enhance the user experience, our focus on building robust core functionality from the ground up meant prioritizing essential features over these additional capabilities.
<br><br>
This trade-off between development time and custom implementation reflects real-world project constraints, where decisions must be balanced to ideal functionality against practical limitations. However, the solid foundation we've built makes it possible to add these features in future iterations of the application.
<br><br>
While the application may not be production-ready, the solid foundation we've built serves its purpose as a learning environment and could be expanded in future iterations. The project successfully achieved its educational goals, allowing us to gain experience with modern web development practices, team collaboration, and the challenges of building a complex application from the ground up in a simulated professional environment.

### Collaboration and Communication 
Our team's ability to work together effectively was greatly enhanced by our chosen tools and practices. Jira helped us maintain clear task ownership and project momentum, while Confluence served as our knowledge base and agreements exchange platform, ensuring that important information was accessible to all team members. Discord was very valuable for daily communication and “quick” problem-solving sessions, while GitHub handled our code organization and review process through pull requests.

### Learning Outcomes 
This project has provided significant learning opportunities in several areas. 
- Full-stack development with modern technologies
- Team collaboration in a distributed environment 
- Project management and time estimation 
- Implementing up to date security measures and best practices 
- Documentation and knowledge sharing


## Project Takeaway
This project has provided significant learning opportunities across multiple aspects of modern software development. Our work with next-generation frontend and backend technologies provided experience across the full development stack. Learning to collaborate effectively as a team taught us the importance of clear communication and coordinated effort, supported by the various tools we mentioned previously. <br>
Our experience with project management and time estimation has been particularly enlightening, showing us the challenges of balancing feature development with available resources. The implementation of security measures taught us not just about current standards, but also about the importance of robust systems. Throughout the project, we learned the critical value of documentation, since not every contributor knows how each team member's work is structured. <br>
These learning experiences extend beyond just technical skills. The project has shown us how theory translates into practice, the importance of adaptability when facing challenges, and the value of teamwork in software development. Moving forward, these insights will be of great benefit in future projects, whether in academic or professional settings. While MeetMate may not be a finished product, the knowledge and experience gained through its development have laid a strong foundation for our future work in software development.
