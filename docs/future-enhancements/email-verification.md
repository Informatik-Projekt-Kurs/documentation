## Future Enhancements

MeetMate plans to introduce additional authentication methods, such as social logins (e.g., Google, GitHub), to provide users with a faster and more convenient signup process. This feature will be implemented while maintaining the highest standards of security and data protection.

Additionally, MeetMate may consider implementing advanced security features like two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security and user verification.
