- **Preline UI:** An open-source UI component library, offering pre-designed, customizable components to streamline web design.

### **Benefits**

**Figma:**
Figma is our main design tool. Its collaborative features and powerful design capabilities let us create, iterate, and improve our designs quickly. With real-time collaboration, team members can work together seamlessly, making edits, sharing feedback, and ensuring alignment without versioning conflicts. Figma also supports developers in translating designs into accurate web implementations by providing precise details about dimensions, colors, and spacing, overcomming the hassle of guessing the right proportions. 

**shadcn:** 
Shadcn components help maintain a consistent design across all platforms, ensuring a cohesive user experience. These pre-built, customizable components can be easily tailored to meet specific design needs, offering flexibility without starting from scratch. By providing a solid foundation, shadcn reduces the time spent on repetitive initial designs, allowing teams to focus on customizing and enhancing the user interface.

**Preline UI:**
For layout inspiration, we look to Preline UI. This helps structure pages and components in ways that are both visually appealing and functionally effective. Preline UI offers a variety of well-designed layouts that can serve as a starting point for creating intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces. By drawing from these layouts, we can ensure that our designs are cohesive, easy to navigate, and aligned with best practices in modern web design, providing a strong foundation for customization and creativity in the final product.
